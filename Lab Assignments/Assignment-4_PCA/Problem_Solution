Used 2 data sets to reduce the dimension of images using PCA.

Analysis was to identify the no. of principal componenets

Data set 1 : Yale Faces
Data set 2 : MNIST

Reconstructed the images using x no. of components


The goal of this assignment is to reduce the dimension of data and yet be able to preserve the significant information.

Algorithm:
1) Load images as (x,x) dimensions
2) Flatten each image as (x.x,1) dimension
3) Find the mean of (x,x) list
4) Subtract each image with the mean and form a mean subtracted image matrix(M) of dimension (n,x.x)
5) Find the covariance matrix(M)
6) Find Eigen Values, Eigen Vectors and display them
7) Reconstruction: mean image + (EigenVector[:-i].transpose(EigenVector[:-i]))
where i is the no. of components

Using - sign because the the vector is sorted in ascending order. But we reconstruct the image using highest eigen values, therefore, we reconstruct it from last i components
